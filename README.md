# homebrew CUDA 11.1 Tensorflow 2.4 Wheel

We are not responsible for any f*ck up in your deep learning environment! Use at your own risk!

On the other hand, it is fun to homebrew something...

* CP35 is compiled at Ubuntu 16.04 environment (Compiled on October - 18th) for Geekerwan Video show
* CP38-2.4.0 is compiled at Ubuntu 20.04 environment (Compiled on October - 24th (RC0)) for Duckietown Duckland
* CP38-2.5.0 is compiled at Ubuntu 20.04 environment (Compiled on October - 24th) by accident

**THIS is NIGHTLY! Not intend for scientific use!!!**

## Want more fun?

If you want to see how Frank's sloppy code will run with your graphics card, go to [here](https://github.com/CWRU-AutonomousVehiclesLab/DuckietownBench) where you can find a realisticly written undergad neural network benchmark.
